These are the tools that were used to produce the charts presented at [0]

Files:
------
fuel.txt: fuel data extracted from the GIZ global fuel price study data preview 2010/2011 [1]
input.txt: economy information from all counties in the world, from the IMF [2]
convert.py: converting these two files into a single comma-separated-values format
plot.py: some Python plotting
chart.html, fuelprice.js: example plotting
fueleconomy.png, fuelrank.png: example images

Usage:
------
To combine the data into a single output file, run:
  python convert.py > data.csv

Plotting is done by modifying the paths in chart.html for jquery, the scripts for Highcharts (download from [3])
and the path of data.csv in fuelprice.js.
